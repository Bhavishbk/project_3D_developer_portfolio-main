## AI Chatbot (local)

A lightweight Node proxy is provided to safely call OpenAI. Steps to run locally:

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your OpenAI API key:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...yourkey...
```

2. Install server dependencies and start the AI server:

```bash
npm install
node ai-server.js
```

3. Run the front-end in a separate terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the site and click the floating "AI" button (bottom-right) to chat about Bhavish's portfolio.

Note: Keep your OpenAI key secret. This proxy is for local development; for production deploy a secure server.
